# Build an ML Pipeline for Short-term Rental Princes in NYC

## Overview
This project is part of the Udacity ML Devops Engineer nanodegree program.

## Summary
The goal of the project is to build a ML Pipeline to estimate the typical price for a given property based on the price of similar properties. The project has five steps in order to download, make an EDA, clean data, test the data, traning a model, and finally automate release the pipeline.
